## Problem Overview (DEFINE)
The goal of this project is to predict the missing salaries of the unseen job postings by analyzing a dataset about job postings and their corresponding salaries.

The possible use-case for this project is for the websites showing job postings to give a better estimate of the salaries and to give job seekers an idea about the salaries based on their credentials.
